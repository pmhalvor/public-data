# Algroithms - Sort

In this note on sorting algorithms, we cover the following algorithms:
- [Bubble Sort](#bubble-sort)
- [Insertion Sort](#insertion-sort)
- [Merge Sort](#merge-sort)
- [Quick Sort](#quick-sort)

_Disclaimer: This entire note was generated by [GitHubCopilot](https://copilot.github.com/). It is not inteended as plagarism, but rather serve as a starting point for further learning on these topics. I'll remove this disclaimer when my personal additions have been added to these notes._

## Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It is implemented using nested loops.

### Pseudocode
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
```

### Key points
- comparison-based
- in-place
- stable

### Complexity
- Time: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Space: O(1)


## Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time by comparing each element to its predecessor and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. It is implemented using nested loops.

### Pseudocode
```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(1, n):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
```

### Key points
- comparison-based
- in-place
- stable

### Complexity
- Time: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Space: O(1)


## Merge Sort

Merge sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides an array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the two halves into a sorted array. It is implemented using recursion.

### Pseudocode
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left = arr[:mid]
        right = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)

        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                arr[k] = left[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left):
            arr[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right):
            arr[k] = right[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

### Key points
- comparison-based
- not in-place
- stable

### Complexity
- Time: O(n log n)
- Space: O(n)


## Quick Sort

Quick sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides an array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then combines the two halves into a sorted array. It is implemented using recursion.

### Pseudocode
```python
def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
    if low < high:
        pivot = partition(arr, low, high)
        quick_sort(arr, low, pivot - 1)
        quick_sort(arr, pivot + 1, high)

def partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] < pivot:
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    return i + 1
```

### Key points
- comparison-based
- in-place
- unstable

### Complexity
- Time: O(n log n)
- Space: O(log n)
